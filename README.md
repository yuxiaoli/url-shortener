# url-shortener

A simple Python-based URL shortener using the `pyshorteners` library. This project takes a long URL as input and generates a shorter, more manageable link.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Run the script with the URL you want to shorten as an argument:

```sh
python main.py <url>
```

Replace `<url>` with the full URL you want to shorten. For example:

python main.py https://www.example.com
```
